    "overview": `
BNG is a Steam product with retro-style aesthetics.
Modern shader & lighting techniques are not supported out-of-the-box, however it does support API integrations with Unity.
Enabling modern graphics using a C# mod integration enabled aesthetics not seen before inside the product.
Hence, "Modern BNG" is a C# mod that enables these never-seen-before aesthetics.
