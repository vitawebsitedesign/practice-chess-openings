    "overview": `
"Machi Koro" is a 2012 tabletop physical board game.
One morning, I had a craving to play a digital version of this product online, but at the time, there was no decent online alternative available. Most implementations had crude workflows & graphics, due to being constructed from extremely generic tabletop frameworks.
This project is a ReactJS implementation of the Machi Koro tabletop product. Too many hours were enjoyed from both implementing & experiencing.
